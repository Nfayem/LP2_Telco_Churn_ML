In the ever-evolving telecommunication sector, retaining customers and accurately forecasting churn is essential for sustaining growth and profitability. This project seeks to harness advanced classification models to deliver a thorough understanding of customer behaviour for a prominent telecommunication company.
The project will focus on three core areas:
1.	Advanced Churn Prediction: We will develop and implement machine learning models to predict which customers are likely to leave the network. This involves identifying critical signals and patterns that precede churn, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.
2.	Customer Lifetime Value Calculation: By estimating the lifetime value of each customer, we can provide actionable insights into the long-term revenue each customer brings. This analysis will help prioritize efforts on high-value customers and inform targeted marketing and retention initiatives.
3.	Analysis of Churn Influencing Factors: Identifying the key factors that drive customers to leave the network is crucial for mitigating churn. We will examine various customer metrics and behaviours to uncover the primary reasons behind churn, allowing for strategic improvements in customer service and satisfaction.
Through this initiative, the telecommunication company will gain a deeper, data-driven understanding of its customer base, enabling more effective decision-making to enhance customer loyalty and drive sustained business success.
